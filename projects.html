            <p>Description:
                In my final year project as a mechanical engineer, I developed a cutting-edge multi-purpose grass-cutting machine designed for enhanced efficiency in agricultural operations. This innovative solution seamlessly integrates three crucial functions simultaneously.
                * Firstly, it facilitates the precise application of solid fertilizers such as urea, optimizing nutrient distribution in the field.
                * Secondly, the equipment is equipped for spraying pesticides and fertilizers, providing a comprehensive approach to crop health management. or is also known as "FertiPest Master" [It combines "Ferti" from fertilizer and "Pest" from pesticide, indicating its capabilities in addressing both aspects of crop care.]
                * Lastly, the multipurpose grass cutter function ensures efficient and timely crop harvesting.
                * Collaborating with my group members, we are also working on 'Patenting' our unique approach to further contribute to the field of sustainable and advanced farming practices.
                * This project not only showcases my technical skills in mechanical design and automation but also reflects my commitment to addressing real-world challenges in agriculture through sustainable and multifunctional solutions.

            <p>Description:
                * Designed a lithium battery pack model using CATIA and performed thermal analysis using ANSYS. Investigated two cooling methods ambient air and air conditioning. Comparative analysis revealed that air conditioning-cooled air significantly enhanced battery temperature control, outperforming ambient air.

                * This project showcased expertise in CAD modeling, simulation, and critical evaluation of thermal management strategies for efficient battery systems.

            <p>Description:
                * This tubing in-wall evaporative air conditioning project involves the installation of a tubing system within the walls of a building to achieve effective and energy-efficient cooling using evaporative air conditioning.

                * The system utilizes water evaporation to cool the incoming air, providing a natural and eco-friendly way to maintain a comfortable indoor environment.

            <h2>"Pendulum Operated Water Pump"</h2>

            <p>Description:
                * In my diploma final year project, I developed a novel solution for water pumping using a pendulum-operated mechanism inspired by Newton's third law. The design ingeniously harnesses the swinging motion of a pendulum through a connecting rod to drive the reciprocating action of the water pump.

                * This innovative approach eliminates the need for electricity, making it a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution for water pumping. The system not only showcases a sustainable alternative but also addresses the challenges of remote or off-grid locations where conventional power sources may be impractical.
